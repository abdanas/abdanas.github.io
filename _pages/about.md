About me
=========

I am a fourth year Ph.D candidate in Operations Research at the Insitute of Operations Research & Analytics (IORA) at NUS, working with Prof. Andrew Lim and Prof. Jussi Keppo. I earned a BS and MS in Industrial Engineering at EMINES School of Industrial Management, UM6P.

I am interested in <b>Data-driven Decision-making</b>, with a focus on leveraging problem-specific structure to develop methodological tools tailored to the problem at hand. My current research lies on the intersection of stochastic control and robust decision-making and learning, with application in inventory management, financial engineering, and personalized learning.
